excerpt: 'A procedure denoted as Line Sampling (LS) has been developed for estimating the reliability of static and dynamical systems. The efficiency and accuracy of the method is shown by application to the subset of the entire spectrum of the posed benchmark problems, i.e. in particular linear systems with random properties. The notion of design point excitation for non-linear systems is discussed and its use extended for reliability estimations of conservative non-linear MDOF systems considering critical conditional excitation.'
