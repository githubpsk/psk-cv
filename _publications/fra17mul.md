excerpt: 'We present a novel methodology for solving multimodal, high-dimensional, model-based Bayesian inverse problems with a focus on applications in biomechanics. Our approach combines sophisticated sampling and optimization strategies to tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensionality and multimodality in the inverse problem setup. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and incorporating physical models, we achieve improved accuracy and computational efficiency in the estimation of biomechanical parameters. The methodology is demonstrated through various case studies, including those related to human tissue modeling and complex material behavior.'
