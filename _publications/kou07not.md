excerpt: 'Given a scalar, stationary, Markov process, this short communication presents a closed-form solution for the first-passage problem for a fixed threshold. The derivation is based on binary processes and the general formula of Siegert [Siegert AJF. On the first-passage time probability problem. Physical Review 1951; 81:617–23]. The relation for the probability density function of the first-passage time is identical to the commonly used formula that was derived by VanMarcke [VanMarcke E. On the distribution of the first-passage time for normal stationary random processes. Journal of Applied Mechanics ASME 1975; 42:215–20] for Gaussian processes.'
