excerpt: 'This paper proposes a novel uncertainty quantification framework for computationally demanding systems characterized by a large vector of non-Gaussian uncertainties. It combines advanced Monte Carlo sampling with Bayesian formulations and uses inexpensive, approximate models in a rigorous manner to achieve accurate uncertainty quantification with reduced computational effort.'
