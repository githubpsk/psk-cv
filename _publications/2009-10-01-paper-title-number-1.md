## Abstract:
> Free energy computations play a critical role in understanding systems where the computation of partition functions or equilibrium probabilities is essential. In this study, we present an efficient method for the computation of free energy changes by minimizing the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between a target distribution and a biased distribution in the form of an adaptive biasing potential. The proposed approach leads to sparse representations in the system’s configurations, thus efficiently reducing the computational burden for large-scale systems. The methodology is illustrated through examples in statistical mechanics, where the free energy is computed in an adaptive manner. This framework is expected to be useful in various applications where free energy calculations are central.
