excerpt: 'This paper presents a predictive coarse-graining approach for simplifying complex systems in computational physics. The method involves using a reduced-order model that captures the essential features of the system while discarding less important details. The approach is applied to various physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing computational costs without sacrificing accuracy in the predictions. The paper also explores the theoretical framework behind the coarse-graining process and its application to multiscale modeling.'
