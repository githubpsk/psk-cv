excerpt: 'This paper presents variational Bayesian approaches for addressing high-dimensional stochastic design problems. By leveraging variational inference, the proposed methods efficiently approximate complex posterior distributions, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy. The framework is demonstrated on various stochastic design scenarios, highlighting its advantages over traditional Monte Carlo and sampling-based techniques.'
