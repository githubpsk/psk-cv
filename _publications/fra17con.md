excerpt: 'This paper addresses the issue of constitutive model error and its impact on uncertainty quantification in computational simulations. The authors propose a methodology for quantifying the uncertainties introduced by errors in the constitutive models used in simulations of material behavior. Through a series of case studies, the paper illustrates how model errors can significantly influence the results of computational predictions, and it proposes an approach for better understanding and mitigating these uncertainties in computational mechanics.'
