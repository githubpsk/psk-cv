excerpt: 'This paper presents a sparse variational Bayesian framework for solving nonlinear inverse problems with applications in elastography. The method leverages variational approximations to efficiently handle complex posterior distributions while maintaining computational feasibility. The proposed approach is demonstrated on nonlinear elastography problems, showcasing its ability to infer mechanical properties of soft tissues with reduced computational cost and improved accuracy compared to traditional Bayesian inference methods.'
